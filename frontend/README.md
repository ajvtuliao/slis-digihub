    ```

- Afterwards, go inside the backend folder and run `source /bin/activate` in Unix-like OS
or `\Scripts\activate.bat` in CMD or `\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in Powershell. 
- Then, install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Afterwards, go inside the include folder and run `flask run`
